# much2do

todo app that i started because i didn't like any of the alternatives out there  
goal is to have three main tasks: events, notes, and todos  
main goal is to learn how redux's data flow mixes in with react and eventually use that to finish UGP  



things to do:
  user model
  notes, events ( should just be an extension of todo )
  login
  design
